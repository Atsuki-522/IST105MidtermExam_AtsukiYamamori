        <h2>Cultural Shocks</h2>
        <p>Moving to a new country can bring with it unexpected surprises and challenges. Here are the top two cultural shocks I experienced upon arriving in Vancouver, Canada:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Politeness and Courtesy</strong>: In Canada, people are incredibly polite. From strangers saying "excuse me" for the smallest inconveniences to cashiers genuinely asking about my day, the warmth and kindness people display here took me by surprise.</li>
            <li><strong>Diversity and Multiculturalism</strong>: Vancouver is a melting pot of cultures, with people from all over the world coexisting and celebrating their backgrounds. This level of diversity was something I hadn’t encountered before, and it initially took some adjustment to navigate and appreciate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Things I Miss</h2>
        <p>Living abroad has also made me realize some things I took for granted back home. Here are the top two things I miss:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional Food</strong>: Although Vancouver has a vibrant food scene, nothing beats the traditional flavors and dishes from my home country. I often find myself craving familiar tastes and home-cooked meals.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and Friends</strong>: Being away from family and friends has been challenging. While technology helps bridge the distance, I miss the warmth and support of having loved ones nearby.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Amazing Things I Love About Vancouver</h2>
        <p>Canada, and Vancouver specifically, has many wonderful aspects. Here are two of my favorite things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature and Scenery</strong>: Surrounded by mountains, ocean, and lush greenery, Vancouver’s natural beauty is breathtaking. It’s a perfect place for outdoor activities, and I’ve enjoyed exploring its stunning landscapes.</li>
            <li><strong>Work-Life Balance</strong>: Canadians prioritize work-life balance, which has been refreshing. It’s common to see people spending time with family, engaging in outdoor activities, or pursuing hobbies after work hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Goal</h2>
        <p>At this stage in my life, my top personal goal is to <strong>achieve professional growth while maintaining a healthy work-life balance</strong>. Moving to a new country has opened up opportunities for self-development, and I aim to learn and adapt to new experiences while building a fulfilling career.</p>
